# PSBB_no2 Command-Line Application

## Overview
PSBB_no2 is a Java command-line application that calculates the minimum number of buses required to transport family members to a wedding. The buses have a capacity of 4 passengers each, and each bus can carry members from up to two different families.

## Features
- Accepts user input for the number of families and the number of members in each family.
- Uses a two-pointer technique to optimize the number of buses required.
- Displays the minimum number of buses needed or an appropriate error message if the input is invalid.

## How to Use
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher must be installed.

### Compilation and Running Instructions
1. **Save the Code**:
   - Save the Java source code in a file named `PSBB_no2.java`.

2. **Compile the Java File**:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where `PSBB_no2.java` is saved.
   - Run the following command to compile the Java file:
     ```sh
     javac PSBB_no2.java
     ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Run the compiled application using the following command:
     ```sh
     java PSBB_no2
     ```

4. **User Input**:
   - The application will prompt you to enter the number of families.
   - Then, enter the number of members in each family, separated by spaces.
   - The application will then calculate and display the minimum number of buses required.

## Example
### Input
```
Enter the number of families: 5
Enter the number of members in each family (separated by a space): 1 2 4 3 3
